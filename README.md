Working through the details of Functional Programming and Category Theory in Typescript.

## Intro

So what the fuck is a monad anwyay?

I've gotten far enough in software development and functional programming that I've used things
that I have been told are monads, like "The Either Monad", and I've understood how to use them.

I can write code that uses Either, but at a certain point down the functional programming
rabit hole, my understanding falls apart. I want to change that.

This repo is about studying category theory enough that I can build my functional programming
skills on a rock solid foundation.
